Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Navneet! ðŸ‘¨


Some github meaning

1 I've noticed, on the languages bar, that some of the languages used on my project are "Hack".
I was just wondering what this "hack" actually means ?

==> A php file is considered a hack file by Gitlab and Github when there is only HTML code in it.
